Notation edge: u-v.
Notation isomorphic: G ≅ H.

Let G, H be graph.

G = (V, E)

Definition: G ≅ H iff for all u # ACCESS VERTICES OF G!

Definition: G is undirected iff for all u, v. u-v implies v-u.
Definition: G is acyclic iff for all u. not u-u.
 
Definition: G is bound iff for all u. exists v. u-v.
