Include equality.

Notation in: a ϵ A.

Let A,B be set.

Definition equality: A = B iff for all x. x ϵ A iff x ϵ B. 

Notation sub: A ⊆ B.
Definition subset: A ⊆ B iff for all x ϵ A. x ϵ B. 

Proposition: A = B iff A ⊆ B and B ⊆ A.

# Notation union: A ∪ B.
# Definition union: x ϵ (A ∪ B) iff x ϵ A or x ϵ B.
# Proposition unionSet: A ∪ B is a set.

# Notation intersection: A ∩ B.
# Definition intersection: x ϵ (A ∩ B) iff x ϵ A and x ϵ B.
# ⊆ ⊇ ⊈ ⊉   ⊊   ⊋
