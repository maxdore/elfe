- concurrent provers
- nested subproofs --> end marker necessary?
- bind taken variable in take'
- sat solver
- unfolding of "Q x. P(x) -> R(x)" possible with "Assume P(x)".

BUGS
- formula Eq not working properly
- nested atoms 
- if final goal is directly given, the sequence does not necessarily belong to the goal (--> only allow direct derivations inside unfolding?)

SANITY
- no double includes of same library
- check variables only quantified once
- allow eid with alphanum and '. (only lower alpha as first??)

LOWLEVEL PARSER FEATURES
- exists atom(x). P  -->  exists x. atom(x) and P 
- Q a,b,c. instead of Q a. Q b. Q c.

FRONTEND
- line-numbers correct also after preprocessing
- ProofStatus per statement
- mapping statement sequence -> orginal text
- post request or /api


SECOND ORDER FEATURES?
improve functions notations


PARAMETRIC DATATYPES -> proposition generator in preprocessor? or possible within parser? -> lookup second order to first order reductions
(plus, zero) in Z is commutative group
plus(A,zero) = A
plus(A,minus(A)) = 0
plus(A,plus(B,C)) = plus(plus(A,B),C)
plus(A,B) = plus(B,A)

PROOFS
sqrt 2 irrational
cantors theorem
