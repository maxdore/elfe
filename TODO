BUGS
- formula Eq not working properly

PARSER
- nested atoms: make fully work, ignore spaces in patterns
- bind taken variable in take' and disallow usage in final goal!
- FIX constructions
- exists atom(x). P  -->  exists x. atom(x) and P 
- Q a,b,c. instead of Q a. Q b. Q c.
- R is transitive, reflexive, ...
- comments not correctly, top level errors do not lead to parsing errors
- by also in hence

FRONTEND
- post request for /api
- shortcuts for special chars
- include found proofs
- print formulas like beagle

SANITY
- no double includes of same library
- case insensitive for markers, e.g., QED
- check variables only quantified once
- no free variables!
- allow eid with alphanum and ' and only lower alpha as first character
