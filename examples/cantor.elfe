Let A be set.

Lemma: for all f. f: A -> (A℘) implies not f is surjective.
Proof: 
    Fix A.
    Assume A is set.
    Assume exists f. f: A -> (A℘) and f is surjective.
    Then in(,A℘)
    Then exists x ∈ A. f{x} = B.
    Hence contradiction.
    Hence not exists f. f: A -> (A℘) and f is surjective.
