Include functions.

Let f: A -> B.
Let g: B -> C.

# ![Vf]: ![VA]:(![VB] : ((sfunction(VF,VA,VB)) => (! [Vg] : (! [VC] : ((sfunction(Vg,VB,VC)) => 
#     ((injective(composition(Vg,Vf))) 
#        => (injective(VF))))))))

Lemma: injective(composition(g,f)) implies f is injective.
Proof:
    Assume injective(composition(g,f)).
    Assume relapp(f,x1,y) and relapp(f,x2,y).
    Take z such that relapp(composition(g,f),x1,z) and relapp(composition(g,f),x2,z).
    Hence sequal(x1,x2).
    Hence f is injective.
