Include relations.

Let R,S be relation.
Let x,y be element.

Lemma: R ⊆ S and S is symmetric implies (R ∪ (R⁻¹)) ⊆ S.
Proof:
    Assume R ⊆ S and S is symmetric.
    Assume (R ∪ (R⁻¹))[x,y].
    Then R[x,y] or (R⁻¹)[x,y].
    Case R[x,y]:
        Then S[x,y].
    qed.
    Case (R⁻¹)[x,y]:
        Then R[y,x].
        Then S[y,x].
        Then S[x,y].
    qed.
    Hence S[x,y].
    Hence (R ∪ (R⁻¹)) ⊆ S.
qed.
