Let relation(R).

Lemma: transitive(R) and symmetric(R) and bound(R) implies R is reflexive.
Proof:
    Assume transitive(R) and symmetric(R) and bound(R).
    Assume x is element.
    Take y such that element(y) and R[x,y] by boundness.
    Then R[y,x] by symmetry.
    Hence R[x,x] .
    Hence R is reflexive.
