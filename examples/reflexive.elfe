Include relations.

Let R be relation.

Lemma: transitive(R) and symmetric(R) and bound(R) implies R is reflexive.
Proof:
    Assume transitive(R) and symmetric(R) and bound(R).
    Proof for all x. R[x,x]:
        Fix x.
        Take y such that R[x,y] by boundness.
        Then R[y,x] by symmetry.
        Then R[x,x].
    qed.
    Hence R is reflexive.
