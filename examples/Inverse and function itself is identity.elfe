Include functions.

Let A,B be set.
Let f: A -> B.

Lemma: f is bijective implies (f⁻¹)∘f is identity.
Proof: 
    Assume f is bijective.
    Assume x ∈ A.
    Take y such that y ∈ B and f[x,y] by function.
    Then (f⁻¹)[y,x] by inverse.
    Then ((f⁻¹)∘f)[x,x] by inverse, composition.
    Hence ((f⁻¹)∘f)[x,x].
    Hence (f⁻¹)∘f is identity.
