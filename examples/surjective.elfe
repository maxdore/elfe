Let f: A -> B.
Let g: B -> C.

Lemma: g∘f is surjective implies g is surjective.
Proof:
    Assume g∘f is surjective.
    Assume z ∈ C.
    Take x such that (g∘f)[x,z].
    Take y such that g[y,z].
    Hence exists y. y ∈ B and g[y,z].
    Hence g is surjective.

    #Assume (f{x1}) = (f{x2}).
    #Then ((g∘f){x1}) = ((g∘f){x2}).
    #Hence x1 = x2.
