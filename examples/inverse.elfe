Let f: A -> B.
Let i: X -> X.

Definition identity: i is identity iff for all x ∈ X. f{x} = x.

Notation inverse: f⁻¹.

Definition inverse: (f⁻¹): B -> C and for all x. f{x} = y implies f{y} = x

Lemma: f bijective implies f⁻¹∘f is identity.
Proof: 
    Assume x ∈ A.
    Then f{x} = y and (f⁻¹){y} = x.
    Hence ((f⁻¹)∘f){x} = x.
