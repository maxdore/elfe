Include sets.

Let A,B be set.

Lemma: equal(comp(union(A,B)),intersection(A,B)).
Proof:
    Proof that subset(comp(union(A,B)),intersection(A,B)):
        Assume in(x,comp(union(A,B))).
        Then not in(x,union(A,B)).
        Then not x ϵ A and not x ϵ B.
        Then in(x,comp(A)) and in(x,comp(B)).
        Hence in(x,intersection(A,B)).
    Proof that subset(intersection(A,B),comp(union(A,B))):
        Trivial.
