Include relations.

Let relation(R).

Lemma: R is transitive and R is symmetric implies R is reflexive.
Proof:
    Case R is empty: Obvious. qed.
    Case R is nonempty:
        Assume R is transitive and R is symmetric.
        Take x,y such that element(x) and element(y) and R[x,y] .
        Then R[y,x] by symmetry.
        Then R[x,x] by transitivity.
        Hence R is reflexive.
