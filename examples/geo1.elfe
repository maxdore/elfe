Lemma betweenCong: for all a,b,c. a-b-c and a-c ≡ a-b implies c = b.
Proof: 
    Assume exists b,c. for all a. a-c-b and a-c ≡ a-b and not c = b.
    Take x such that x-c-b and not x = b and not x = c.
    Then x-c ≡ x-b.
    Take y such that y-x-c and not x = y.
    Then y-c-b and not y-c ≡ y-b. 
    Hence contradiction.
