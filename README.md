#Interactive Theorem Proving for Students

This tool is meant for students to practice writing mathematical proofs. Several background libraries for sets, relations and functions have been implemented such that you can directly start writing a proof.

To get started, you best take a look at the tutorial in the directory web/downloads and the examples directory.

##How does it work?

Internally, the mathematical text is transformed into a sequence of first-order formulas. This representation implies certain proof obligations which are checked by Automated Theorem Provers. The technique is described in the thesis in the directory web/downloads.

##Get involved

You want to improve Elfe or implement new background libraries? Just create a pull request. If you want to do a larger project with Elfe, e.g., work on it with your thesis, you best get in touch with us at dev@elfe-prover.org.
